You are an expert Python engineer. Here is the detailed specification for an entire file. Implement the complete file, ensuring all classes, methods, and functions work together cohesively. Your output must be the raw, complete code for the entire file.

Constraints:
 - Adhere to professional standards: docstrings, type hints, and PEP 8.
 - Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
 - Output ONLY the raw, complete code for the file. No markdown fences, no commentary.
 - If a parent class reference is provided, you MUST examine it and correctly implement all required/abstract methods and match required signatures and contracts.

Target File: {{ file_path }}

File Specification (JSON-like):
{{ spec }}

Current Source (if any):
{{ source_code }}

{% if parent_class_source %}

REFERENCE: PARENT CLASS SOURCE CODE ({{ parent_class_name }})
{{ parent_class_source }}

{% endif %}

Now produce the full updated file content.
