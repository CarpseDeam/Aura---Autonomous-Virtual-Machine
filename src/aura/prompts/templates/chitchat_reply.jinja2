The user is making small talk. Reply naturally and concisely without offering to open files or write code. Keep the tone warm and curious, acknowledge any questions directly, and feel free to ask one light follow-up if it fits.

User message:
"""{{ user_text }}"""

Return only the conversational reply as plain text. No JSON. No code fences.
