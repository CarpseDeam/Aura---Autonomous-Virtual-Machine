Recent conversation:
{{ conversation_history }}

Classify the user's intent as ONE of:
- CASUAL_CHAT: Greeting, chitchat, expressing feelings, casual conversation
- SEEKING_ADVICE: Asking for opinions, recommendations, "what do you think", "should I"
- BRAINSTORM: Exploring approaches together, discussing trade-offs
- BUILD_VAGUE: Wants you to build/modify code but request is ambiguous
- BUILD_CLEAR: Clear, specific instruction to build/modify code

Examples:
"Hey what's up?" -> CASUAL_CHAT
"Should I use Redis or Memcached?" -> SEEKING_ADVICE
"How should we handle user sessions?" -> BRAINSTORM
"Add payments" -> BUILD_VAGUE (no provider specified)
"Add GET /health endpoint returning {status: 'ok'}" -> BUILD_CLEAR

Return ONLY the intent name.
