You are analyzing the user's latest message to decide which single intent label applies.

User message: {{ user_text }}

Recent dialogue snapshot:
{{ conversation_history }}

Available intents:
- CASUAL_CHAT: greetings, check-ins, venting, or other non-task chatter.
- SEEKING_ADVICE: explicit requests for opinions, recommendations, comparisons, or evaluation.
- BRAINSTORM: collaborative exploration of approaches where the user wants to ideate together.
- BUILD_VAGUE: the user wants code changes but the request lacks detail; clarification is needed.
- BUILD_CLEAR: the user gives specific implementation instructions with enough detail to execute.

Decision guide:
1. If the user is clearly requesting a recommendation, comparison, or opinion (phrases like "what do you think", "should I", "vs", "recommend"), default to SEEKING_ADVICE unless the message also contains precise build instructions that dominate the request.
2. If the user wants to create or modify code but details are missing or ambiguous, choose BUILD_VAGUE.
3. Use BUILD_CLEAR only when the request is actionable as written (e.g., exact endpoint, file, or behavior).
4. When the user invites joint exploration without committing to implementation, classify as BRAINSTORM.
5. If none of the above apply and the user is just chatting, choose CASUAL_CHAT.

Edge handling:
- Prior conversation may already contain context. If the new message simply continues an earlier build plan with clarity, respect that and choose BUILD_CLEAR or BUILD_VAGUE accordingly.
- If multiple intents seem plausible, pick the one that best reflects the next action Aura should take. Err toward dialogue (SEEKING_ADVICE or BRAINSTORM) before BUILD_CLEAR if doubt remains.

Return only the intent label (e.g., `SEEKING_ADVICE`).
