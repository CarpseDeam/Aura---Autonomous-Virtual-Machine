Master rules for AURA agents - Precision Edition
These are the core laws that ensure reliable, accurate code generation.
"""

# THE MOST CRITICAL RULE - Technology constraints
TECHNOLOGY_CONSTRAINT_RULE = """
**LAW: TECHNOLOGY CONSTRAINTS ARE SACRED**
- When a specific technology, framework, or library is specified (e.g., "use Pygame"), you MUST use EXACTLY that technology
- You are ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN from substituting alternatives
- Common violations that will cause immediate failure:
  - Replacing Pygame with tcod, pygame-ce, or any other game library
  - Replacing Flask with Django, FastAPI, or any other web framework  
  - Replacing React with Vue, Angular, or any other frontend framework
- If you cannot fulfill the request with the specified technology, you must explicitly state this
"""

# Import validation to prevent fictional modules
IMPORT_VALIDATION_RULE = """
**LAW: IMPORTS MUST BE REAL**
- Every import you specify must be from:
  1. The exact framework specified by the user, OR
  2. Python's standard library, OR  
  3. An explicitly approved third-party library
- NEVER import from modules that don't exist
- NEVER create fictional module names
"""

# Ensure specifications are treated as contracts
SPECIFICATION_COMPLIANCE_RULE = """
**LAW: SPECIFICATIONS ARE CONTRACTS**
- Every method, function, and class in the specification MUST be implemented
- Signatures must match EXACTLY (name, parameters, types)
- No methods may be added or removed without explicit instruction
"""

# No placeholder code allowed
NO_PLACEHOLDER_RULE = """
**LAW: COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATIONS ONLY**
- Every function must be fully implemented
- NO comments like "TODO", "Add logic here", "Implement this", etc.
- If you don't know how to implement something, provide a working basic version
- Empty functions should at least have 'pass' or return appropriate defaults
"""

# Clear communication over assumptions
CLEAR_COMMUNICATION_RULE = """
**LAW: EXPLICIT OVER IMPLICIT**
- State technology choices explicitly
- List all imports explicitly
- Specify all requirements explicitly
- When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than assume
"""

# Workspace sandbox - ALL code must be in workspace/
WORKSPACE_SANDBOX_RULE = """
**LAW: WORKSPACE SANDBOX**
- ALL file generation MUST occur within 'workspace/' directory
- All file paths must start with 'workspace/'
- NEVER create or modify files outside the workspace
"""

# Code quality standards
CLEAN_CODE_RULE = """
**LAW: PROFESSIONAL CODE QUALITY**
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add type hints to all function signatures
"""

# Output format rules
RAW_CODE_OUTPUT_RULE = """
**LAW: RAW CODE OUTPUT ONLY**
- Your entire response MUST be only the raw, complete Python code for the assigned file
- Do not write any explanations, comments, conversational text, or markdown formatting before or after the code block
- Your response must start with the first line of code (e.g., `import os`) and end with the last line of code
"""

# Type hinting requirements
TYPE_HINTING_RULE = """
**LAW: MANDATORY TYPE HINTING**
- All function and method signatures MUST include type hints for all arguments and for the return value
- Use the `typing` module where necessary (e.g., `List`, `Dict`, `Optional`)
- Example of a correct signature: `def my_function(name: str, count: int) -> bool:`
"""

# Documentation requirements
DOCSTRING_RULE = """
**LAW: COMPREHENSIVE DOCSTRINGS**
- Every module, class, and public function MUST have a comprehensive Google-style docstring
- Docstrings must describe the purpose, arguments (`Args:`), and return value (`Returns:`)
"""

# Import path rules for workspace
WORKSPACE_IMPORT_RULE = """
**LAW: WORKSPACE-RELATIVE IMPORTS**
- All import statements in the code you generate MUST be relative to the workspace root
- You are strictly FORBIDDEN from using `src.` in any import path
- For example, if the project structure is `workspace/utils/helpers.py`, the correct import is `from utils.helpers import ...`
"""

# Architectural philosophy (simplified and focused)
ARCHITECT_PHILOSOPHY_RULE = """
**LAW: THE ARCHITECT'S IDENTITY**
- You are a technical architect, not a philosopher
- Create precise JSON blueprints that can be programmatically validated
- Every blueprint must be implementable with the specified technologies
- Focus on clarity, not cleverness
"""

# Single source of truth for configuration
SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_RULE = """
**LAW: CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION**
- ALL projects requiring configuration MUST include a dedicated `config.py` file
- No magic numbers or hardcoded values scattered throughout the codebase
- All constants, API endpoints, file paths must be defined in `config.py`
"""

# Separation of concerns
SEPARATION_OF_CONCERNS_RULE = """
**LAW: THE ORCHESTRATOR PATTERN**
- `main.py` serves ONLY for application initialization and the main execution loop
- Core entities must each have their own dedicated module files
- `main.py` orchestrates; it does not implement
"""

# Modular design principles
MODULAR_DESIGN_RULE = """
**LAW: MODULAR EXCELLENCE**
- Every file and class must have a single, well-defined responsibility
- Circular dependencies are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
- Related functionality must be logically grouped into packages
"""

# The engineer's approach (simplified)
ENGINEER_PHILOSOPHY_RULE = """
**LAW: THE ENGINEER'S PHILOSOPHY**
- Write code that works first, optimize later
- Follow the specification exactly
- Use the specified technologies without substitution
- Complete every function - no placeholders
"""
