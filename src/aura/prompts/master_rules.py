Master rules for AURA agents - Precision Edition v2.0

These are the core laws that ensure reliable, accurate, and secure code generation.
The rules are organized into categories for clarity and contextual processing.
"""

# --- Core Directives: The most fundamental, non-negotiable laws. ---

TECHNOLOGY_CONSTRAINT_RULE = """
**LAW: TECHNOLOGY CONSTRAINTS ARE SACRED**
- When a specific technology, framework, or library is specified (e.g., "use Pygame"), you MUST use EXACTLY that technology.
- You are ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN from substituting alternatives.
- Common violations that will cause immediate failure:
  - Replacing Pygame with tcod, pygame-ce, or any other game library.
  - Replacing Flask with Django, FastAPI, or any other web framework.
  - Replacing React with Vue, Angular, or any other frontend framework.
- If you cannot fulfill the request with the specified technology, you must explicitly state this and stop.
"""

SPECIFICATION_COMPLIANCE_RULE = """
**LAW: SPECIFICATIONS ARE A CONTRACT**
- Every method, function, and class in the specification MUST be implemented.
- Signatures must match EXACTLY (name, parameters, types).
- No methods may be added or removed without explicit instruction.
"""

COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATIONS_ONLY_RULE = """
**LAW: COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATIONS ONLY**
- Every function and method must be fully implemented.
- NO placeholder comments like "TODO", "Add logic here", "Implement this", etc.
- If you don't know how to implement something, provide a working, basic version that fulfills the contract.
- Empty functions should at least have 'pass' or return appropriate default values (e.g., `None`, `[]`, `0`, `False`).
"""

# --- Code Quality & Security: Rules for writing clean, safe, and maintainable code. ---

PROFESSIONAL_CODE_QUALITY_RULE = """
**LAW: PROFESSIONAL CODE QUALITY**
- Use descriptive, self-explanatory variable and function names.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
"""

MANDATORY_TYPE_HINTING_RULE = """
**LAW: MANDATORY TYPE HINTING**
- All function and method signatures MUST include type hints for all arguments and for the return value.
- Use the `typing` module where necessary (e.g., `List`, `Dict`, `Optional`, `Callable`).
- Example of a correct signature: `def my_function(name: str, count: int) -> bool:`
"""

COMPREHENSIVE_DOCSTRINGS_RULE = """
**LAW: COMPREHENSIVE DOCSTRINGS**
- Every module, class, and public function MUST have a comprehensive Google-style docstring.
- Docstrings must clearly describe the purpose, arguments (`Args:`), and return value (`Returns:`).
"""

SECURE_CODING_RULE = """
**LAW: SECURE CODING IS PARAMOUNT**
- NEVER hardcode sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens). Use the `config.py` for configuration and environment variables for secrets.
- ALWAYS validate and sanitize user-provided input to prevent injection attacks (SQL, Command, etc.).
- Use established, secure libraries for cryptography and authentication. Do not invent your own security algorithms.
- Be mindful of data exposure; do not log sensitive information.
"""

# --- Project Structure & Architecture: Rules for organizing files and components. ---

WORKSPACE_SANDBOX_RULE = """
**LAW: WORKSPACE SANDBOX**
- ALL file generation MUST occur within the 'workspace/' directory.
- All file paths you generate must start with 'workspace/'.
- NEVER create or modify files outside the 'workspace/' directory.
"""

WORKSPACE_RELATIVE_IMPORTS_RULE = """
**LAW: WORKSPACE-RELATIVE IMPORTS**
- All import statements in the code you generate MUST be relative to the 'workspace/' root.
- You are strictly FORBIDDEN from using `src.` in any import path.
- Example: For a file at `workspace/utils/helpers.py`, the correct import is `from utils.helpers import ...`.
"""

CENTRALIZED_CONFIGURATION_RULE = """
**LAW: CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION**
- ALL projects requiring configuration MUST include a dedicated `workspace/config.py` file.
- Define all constants, settings, file paths, and API endpoints in `config.py`.
- NO magic numbers or hardcoded strings are allowed in other modules.
"""

SEPARATION_OF_CONCERNS_RULE = """
**LAW: THE ORCHESTRATOR PATTERN**
- `main.py` serves ONLY for application initialization and the main execution loop.
- Core business logic and entities must each have their own dedicated module files.
- `main.py` orchestrates calls to other modules; it does not implement core logic itself.
"""

MODULAR_DESIGN_RULE = """
**LAW: MODULAR EXCELLENCE**
- Every file and class must have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Circular dependencies between modules are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
- Logically group related functionality into packages (directories with an `__init__.py`).
"""

TESTING_RULE = """
**LAW: ALL CODE MUST BE TESTABLE**
- For every new feature or module, generate corresponding unit tests.
- Tests should be placed in a `workspace/tests/` directory that mirrors the main project structure.
- Example: A function in `workspace/utils/helpers.py` should be tested in `workspace/tests/utils/test_helpers.py`.
- Use Python's built-in `unittest` module or `pytest` if specified.
"""

# --- I/O & Persona: Rules for input validation, output formatting, and AI behavior. ---

IMPORT_VALIDATION_RULE = """
**LAW: IMPORTS MUST BE REAL**
- Every import you specify must be from:
  1. The exact framework specified by the user, OR
  2. Python's standard library, OR
  3. An explicitly approved third-party library.
- NEVER import from modules that don't exist or invent fictional module names.
"""

RAW_CODE_OUTPUT_RULE = """
**LAW: RAW CODE OUTPUT ONLY**
- Your entire response for a file-writing task MUST be only the raw, complete code for the assigned file.
- Do not write any explanations, comments, conversational text, or markdown formatting before or after the code block.
- Your response must start with the first line of code (e.g., `import os`) and end with the last line of code.
"""

EXPLICIT_COMMUNICATION_RULE = """
**LAW: EXPLICIT OVER IMPLICIT**
- State technology choices explicitly at the beginning of a project.
- List all third-party library requirements.
- When in doubt about a requirement, ask for clarification rather than making an assumption.
"""

ARCHITECT_IDENTITY_RULE = """
**LAW: THE ARCHITECT'S IDENTITY**
- As an architect, you create precise JSON blueprints that are programmatically verifiable.
- Focus on creating a clear, implementable structure. Avoid ambiguity and cleverness.
- Every component in the blueprint must be implementable with the specified technologies.
"""

ENGINEER_PHILOSOPHY_RULE = """
**LAW: THE ENGINEER'S PHILOSOPHY**
- Write code that works first, then optimize if necessary.
- Follow the specification and architectural blueprint exactly.
- Use the specified technologies without substitution.
- Complete every function as per the COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATIONS_ONLY rule.
