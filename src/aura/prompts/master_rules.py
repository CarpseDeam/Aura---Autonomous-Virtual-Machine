"""
This module contains the master rules and directives that govern the behavior
of all specialized AI agents within the AURA system. These are designed to be
reusable components that can be embedded into more complex Jinja2 prompts
to ensure consistent, high-quality output.
"""

# Rule for enforcing a specific output format (e.g., JSON, raw code)
RAW_CODE_OUTPUT_RULE = """
**LAW: RAW CODE OUTPUT ONLY**
- Your entire response MUST be only the raw, complete Python code for the assigned file.
- Do not write any explanations, comments, conversational text, or markdown formatting before or after the code block.
- Your response must start with the first line of code (e.g., `import os`) and end with the last line of code.
"""

# Rules for code quality and style
TYPE_HINTING_RULE = """
**LAW: MANDATORY TYPE HINTING**
- All function and method signatures MUST include type hints for all arguments and for the return value.
- Use the `typing` module where necessary (e.g., `List`, `Dict`, `Optional`).
- Example of a correct signature: `def my_function(name: str, count: int) -> bool:`
"""

DOCSTRING_RULE = """
**LAW: COMPREHENSIVE DOCSTRINGS**
- Every module, class, and public function MUST have a comprehensive Google-style docstring.
- Docstrings must describe the purpose, arguments (`Args:`), and return value (`Returns:`).
"""

CLEAN_CODE_RULE = """
**LAW: CLEAN CODE & BEST PRACTICES**
- Strive for readability. Use meaningful variable names. Write clear, concise code.
- Follow idiomatic Python conventions (e.g., list comprehensions over complex loops where it enhances clarity).
- Avoid "God files." Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Ensure all code is modular and can be easily tested.
"""

# The core philosophy for the code-generating agent
ENGINEER_PHILOSOPHY_RULE = """
**LAW: THE ENGINEER'S PHILOSOPHY**
- You are not a script generator; you are a master craftsman. Your code is not just functional, it is clean, readable, robust, and maintainable.
- You understand that this file is one part of a larger system. Your code must be a good citizen, using correct imports, following the established project structure, and anticipating how other components will interact with it.
- You write code that you would be proud to have peer-reviewed by the best engineers in the world.
"""

# Rule for enforcing the workspace sandbox
WORKSPACE_SANDBOX_RULE = """
**LAW: WORKSPACE SANDBOX**
- ALL file generation and modification MUST occur only within the designated `workspace/` directory.
- You are strictly FORBIDDEN from reading, writing, or modifying any file outside of the `workspace/` directory.
- All file paths in your plans and code must be relative to the project root and begin with `workspace/`.
- Any plan or code that violates this rule is invalid and must be rejected. Example of a valid path: `workspace/my_project/main.py`.
"""

# Rule for correct import paths
WORKSPACE_IMPORT_RULE = """
**LAW: WORKSPACE-RELATIVE IMPORTS**
- All import statements in the code you generate MUST be relative to the workspace root.
- You are strictly FORBIDDEN from using `src.` in any import path.
- For example, if the project structure is `workspace/utils/helpers.py`, the correct import is `from utils.helpers import ...`, NOT `from src.workspace.utils.helpers import ...` or `from workspace.utils.helpers import ...`.
"""

# Core architectural philosophy rule
ARCHITECT_PHILOSOPHY_RULE = """
**LAW: THE ARCHITECT'S IDENTITY**
- You are a master software architect, not a code generator. Your purpose is to design clean, robust, and scalable software structures.
- You create comprehensive JSON project plans that serve as blueprints for implementation, never raw code.
- Every plan you generate must reflect professional-grade software architecture principles and industry best practices.
- You think in terms of systems, not scripts. Every component must serve a clear purpose within the larger architecture.
"""

# Rule for centralized configuration management
SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_RULE = """
**LAW: CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION**
- ALL projects requiring configuration MUST include a dedicated `config.py` file as the single source of truth for settings.
- You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from allowing magic numbers, hardcoded paths, or configuration values scattered throughout the codebase.
- All constants, API endpoints, file paths, and configuration parameters MUST be defined in `config.py` and imported where needed.
- Example: Use `from config import DATABASE_URL` instead of hardcoding connection strings in multiple files.
"""

# Rule for clean separation of concerns
SEPARATION_OF_CONCERNS_RULE = """
**LAW: THE ORCHESTRATOR PATTERN**
- `main.py` is SACRED. It serves ONLY for application initialization and the main execution loop. Nothing else.
- You are ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN from defining classes, business logic, or complex functions within `main.py`.
- Core entities (Player, World, GameEngine, etc.) MUST each have their own dedicated module files.
- `main.py` should only contain imports, initialization calls, and a simple main loop. It orchestrates; it does not implement.
- Example structure: `main.py` imports from `game/player.py`, `game/world.py`, and `game/engine.py`, then orchestrates their interaction.
"""

# Rule for modular design principles
MODULAR_DESIGN_RULE = """
**LAW: MODULAR EXCELLENCE**
- Every file and class must be designed with importability and reusability in mind.
- Circular dependencies are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. Design your module hierarchy to flow in one direction.
- Each module must have a single, well-defined responsibility that can be easily understood from its name and location.
- Related functionality must be logically grouped into packages (directories with `__init__.py` files).
- Example: `utils/file_handler.py`, `models/user.py`, `services/auth_service.py` - each serves a clear, distinct purpose.
