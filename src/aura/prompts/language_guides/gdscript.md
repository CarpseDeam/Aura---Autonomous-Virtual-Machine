**LAW: ADHERE TO GDSCRIPT SYNTAX AND CONVENTIONS**
- You MUST use GDScript syntax and all files must end with the `.gd` extension.
- Scripts must extend a Godot class (e.g., `extends Node`, `extends CharacterBody3D`).
- Use static typing: `var variable_name: Type = value`.
- Use signals (`signal my_signal`) for event-based communication.
- Reference nodes with the `$` syntax (e.g., `$Player/Camera3D`).
- Use Godot's built-in virtual functions like `_ready()`, `_process(delta)`, and `_input(event)`.
